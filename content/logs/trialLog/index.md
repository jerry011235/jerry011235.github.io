<h3>Structuring the site</h3>
I was (still am, honestly) debating whether I should make the site data centric or portfolio centric and mulling over its overall structure. Data centric in the sense I'd put more effort on blogs and less on ornamental css. Portfolio centric would've called for more effort into the presentation of the site (putting 'em sweet p5.js and three.js skills to use) for the sake of creating a frontend portfolio.  

Take a guess on the winning idea (Hint : you're browsing a Hugo theme)  
Maybe one day, I'd be able to write a static site generator of my own and wouldn't be relying on Hugo.

So, having made that decision, I moved onto the tougher part - deciding the kind of content I want to put up here. <br>Initially, I'd considered splitting the blogs into two sections -

- Technical
- Journalling

Evidently, I ended up scraping that plan. Instead, I'm going with this idea - two completely different sections for blogs and logs. Blogs for anything I find interesting (I'll try to keep it technical for the most part), and Logs for journalling.

<h3>Status Update</h3>
<p>I've been up to a lot of things. No, it's not a good idea. I should either learn to juggle stuff better or finish one thing before I start something else. My current schedule is a jumbled mess of 

- Delving into Deep Learning through <a href="https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106184">this course</a>
- Following Frank Dvorak's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/frankslaboratory">youtube channel</a> for creative coding
- Following Daniel Shiffman's ebook <a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/">The Nature of Code</a>
- Realizing I'd started running before I learnt how to walk. So I'm learning how to use TensorFlow and PyTorch (yes, I used to handcode most of it)
- Learning TypeScript
- Polishing React
- Learning how to properly document code and write unit tests
- Learning how to make microservices
- Redis and Pub-Sub queues
- Finishing `Hold Up the Sky` and `The Song of Achilles`</p>

<h3>To-Do</h3>
It's the same list as the status update, unfortunately. I just need to manage my time better. And think of a proper schedule while I'm at it.<br>
Apart from that, I need to   

- look at submissions for past kaggle competitions to see how the `experts` think.
- fill gaps in my React knowledge
- learn how to use at least one cloud service provider
- make a chrome extension to fill out forms for me. I'm tired of myworkdayjobs and their 5 part application forms.
