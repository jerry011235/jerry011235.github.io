<h2>Hi,</h2><p>I'm Debanwita, a 3rd year B-Tech undergrad, pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.silicon.ac.in">Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar</a>.<br>
Recently, my interests have been leaning towards Web Development and Machine Learning (primarily, Deep Learning). Curently following <a href="https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106184">this wonderful course</a> and the <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">mandatory ebook</a>.</p>
<p>I practice DSA on <a href="https://www.leetcode.com/dm2711">Leetcode</a> and dabble in <a href="https://openprocessing.org/class/1640/">generative code</a> (math pretty).</p> 
<p>I read(and sometimes write) fiction, predominantly fantasy and sci-fi, listen to rock music and inhale netflix for survival. I'm currently reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51227070-to-hold-up-the-sky">To Hold Up The Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13623848-the-song-of-achilles?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=RSIpE50FPd&rank=1">The Song of Achilles</a>. I used to be an avid quizzer and debater back in school (something I've been meaning to pick back up) and might randomly spew a ton of junk thanks to it. Also, I paint :D</p>
